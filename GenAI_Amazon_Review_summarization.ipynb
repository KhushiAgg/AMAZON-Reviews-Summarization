              "[<span>So Earlier I posted my 2 weeks review about this phone,now it has been one month since i bought it and this is what I found great and not so great about this phone<br/>I'll write about my experience now<br/>1.One plus UI obviously is really good with almost zero bloatwares in it, The UI is really good and does not hang<br/>2.For charging- Yes this phone comes with a 80 Watt charger but supports upto 67W charging still making it go from 0-100 percent in less than an hour<br/>3.Battery lasts really good for a normal user, I have tested myself by going outside around 9 am at 100 percent battery and returning home late at night with still about 35% charge<br/>4.The phone has a plastic back and my variant i.e pastel lime is really good, the look is really premium<br/>5.Great sounding stereo speakers probably the loudest and clearest in this price segment,<br/>6. Display is IPS LCD not AMOLED which can be kind of a con for this phone but still being an IPS LCD it does not disappoints the standard is there.<br/>7. IPS LCD is 120hz which is very smooth but on some applications it automatically locks on 60hz like netflix youtube and many more apps.<br/>8. One plus has promised to give this phone 2 major android updates and 3 years of security updates you can find more about on their website<br/>A. Performance and camera<br/>1. It comes in with a snapdragon 695 5g processor in it which is pretty common in this budget<br/>2. Gaming is good as per the price segment, You can play Call of duty mobile(Smooth),apex legends and genshin impact smoothly on low settings obviously update-BGMI works on HD settings and MAX frame rate<br/>3. It has 8 gb ram in it and 8 gb is more than sufficient for normal use and more over it has expandable ram as well upto 8 gb, so what you can do is make your phone into<br/>8+8 ram<br/>4. Camera quality was really bad at first but an update which came around 2nd week of may fixed the camera by a lot. Daylight photos have gotten good HDR and colors are great<br/>Although it does not provide Punchy colors in photos , its not a flaw for me because i dont like punchy color<br/>5. Night performance for camera can still be better.<br/>6.Video recording is available at only 1080p@30fps due to limitations of the processor, rest the video capture works great<br/>7.There is a slow mo feature as well also front+back camera recording simultaneously<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>There is a lot for improvement on this phone and the journey has just started , Lets hope that the updates can fix some of the issues and bring us new features as well<br/>For me I am a normal user with a little bit of gaming, I can rate this phone around 8/10 (top 5 in this range)<br/>Obviously there are better options but You can give this phone a chance as well :D<br/>🐐🐐</span>,\n",
              " <span>Pros and Cons as per one month of usage: -<br/><br/>Pro's<br/>1. Packed with completed assessories including 80W charger, Transparent back Case and pre-applied screen protector. Won't cost extra on pocket.<br/><br/>2. Smooth software experience with 120 Hz high refresh rate.<br/><br/>3. 8 GB &amp; above RAM and has excellent ram management.<br/><br/>4. True 5G with 10-11 5G bands, as minimum 8 5G bands are necessary for better and stable 5G network coverage.<br/><br/>5. As expected, disappointment on camera has been fixed with 2nd software updates in the 1st week of May 2023.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>1. Slightly less bright display may irritate in sunlight.<br/><br/>2. The worst Google dailer that won't allow silent call recording, to directly place a videos call without sharing personal data on Google meet app i.e. without signing in to another Google spyware especially when two SIMs are installed.<br/><br/>3. The tall &amp; 200 gms, a bulky smartphone would require both the hand for operation for most of the people.<br/><br/>4. One plus has not clarified anything about future updates. But users can expect 2 Android updates and 3 years of security update.<br/><br/>5.

              " <span>I have been using this phone for a week now and I am very impressed with its performance and features. The phone is sleek and lightweight, with a beautiful chromatic gray color that changes hue depending on the light. The display is bright and crisp, with a smooth 90Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and gaming a pleasure. The camera is also amazing, with a 64MP main sensor that captures stunning details and colors. The night mode is especially impressive, as it can take clear and bright photos even in low-light conditions. The battery life is also great, as it can last for a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports fast charging with the included 30W charger, which can charge the phone from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. The phone also has 5G connectivity, which makes browsing and streaming faster and smoother. The phone runs on OxygenOS 12, which is based on Android 12. The software is clean and user-friendly, with no bloatware or ads. It also has some useful features like dark mode, always-on display, Zen mode, and more. The phone also has a headphone jack, which is rare these days. The sound quality is decent, both from the speakers and the earphones. The phone also has a fingerprint scanner on the power button, which is fast and reliable. The phone also has face unlock, which works well in most situations.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with this phone and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly 5G smartphone with great performance and features. It is definitely worth the price and it offers a lot of value for money. It is one of the best phones I have ever used and I don't regret buying it at all.</span>,\n",

            "So Earlier I posted my 2 weeks review about this phone,now it has been one month since i bought it and this is what I found great and not so great about this phoneI'll write about my experience now1.One plus UI obviously is really good with almost zero bloatwares in it, The UI is really good and does not hang2.For charging- Yes this phone comes with a 80 Watt charger but supports upto 67W charging still making it go from 0-100 percent in less than an hour3.Battery lasts really good for a normal user, I have tested myself by going outside around 9 am at 100 percent battery and returning home late at night with still about 35% charge4.The phone has a plastic back and my variant i.e pastel lime is really good, the look is really premium5.Great sounding stereo speakers probably the loudest and clearest in this price segment,6. Display is IPS LCD not AMOLED which can be kind of a con for this phone but still being an IPS LCD it does not disappoints the standard is there.7. IPS LCD is 120hz which is very smooth but on some applications it automatically locks on 60hz like netflix youtube and many more apps.8. One plus has promised to give this phone 2 major android updates and 3 years of security updates you can find more about on their websiteA. Performance and camera1. It comes in with a snapdragon 695 5g processor in it which is pretty common in this budget2. Gaming is good as per the price segment, You can play Call of duty mobile(Smooth),apex legends and genshin impact smoothly on low settings obviously update-BGMI works on HD settings and MAX frame rate3. It has 8 gb ram in it and 8 gb is more than sufficient for normal use and more over it has expandable ram as well upto 8 gb, so what you can do is make your phone into8+8 ram4. Camera quality was really bad at first but an update which came around 2nd week of may fixed the camera by a lot. Daylight photos have gotten good HDR and colors are greatAlthough it does not provide Punchy colors in photos , its not a flaw for me because i dont like punchy color5. Night performance for camera can still be better.6.Video recording is available at only 1080p@30fps due to limitations of the processor, rest the video capture works great7.There is a slow mo feature as well also front+back camera recording simultaneouslyConclusionThere is a lot for improvement on this phone and the journey has just started , Lets hope that the updates can fix some of the issues and bring us new features as wellFor me I am a normal user with a little bit of gaming, I can rate this phone around 8/10 (top 5 in this range)Obviously there are better options but You can give this phone a chance as well :D🐐🐐\n",

            "Pros and Cons as per one month of usage: -Pro's1. Packed with completed assessories including 80W charger, Transparent back Case and pre-applied screen protector. Won't cost extra on pocket.2. Smooth software experience with 120 Hz high refresh rate.3. 8 GB & above RAM and has excellent ram management.4. True 5G with 10-11 5G bands, as minimum 8 5G bands are necessary for better and stable 5G network coverage.5. As expected, disappointment on camera has been fixed with 2nd software updates in the 1st week of May 2023.Cons1. Slightly less bright display may irritate in sunlight.2. The worst Google dailer that won't allow silent call recording, to directly place a videos call without sharing personal data on Google meet app i.e. without signing in to another Google spyware especially when two SIMs are installed.3. The tall & 200 gms, a bulky smartphone would require both the hand for operation for most of the people.4. One plus has not clarified anything about future updates. But users can expect 2 Android updates and 3 years of security update.5. Existing 2-3 uninstallable bloatwares could have been avoided to make the Oxygen OS  = (Colour OS - bloatwares).6. Some youtubers may say it doesn't support 4K videos. It is upto you, how many times you watch 4K videos online that requires 5-7 times of data? If you are comfortable with 5-7 times extra data recharge, definitely you should look at 4K supporting devices.7. Does not justify it's ₹ 20k price. Brand has cleverly started with the minimum 8GB varient to earn from this unwanted & forcefull specs.\n",

            "I have been using this phone for a week now and I am very impressed with its performance and features. The phone is sleek and lightweight, with a beautiful chromatic gray color that changes hue depending on the light. The display is bright and crisp, with a smooth 90Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and gaming a pleasure. The camera is also amazing, with a 64MP main sensor that captures stunning details and colors. The night mode is especially impressive, as it can take clear and bright photos even in low-light conditions. The battery life is also great, as it can last for a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports fast charging with the included 30W charger, which can charge the phone from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. The phone also has 5G connectivity, which makes browsing and streaming faster and smoother. The phone runs on OxygenOS 12, which is based on Android 12. The software is clean and user-friendly, with no bloatware or ads. It also has some useful features like dark mode, always-on display, Zen mode, and more. The phone also has a headphone jack, which is rare these days. The sound quality is decent, both from the speakers and the earphones. The phone also has a fingerprint scanner on the power button, which is fast and reliable. The phone also has face unlock, which works well in most situations.Overall, I am very happy with this phone and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly 5G smartphone with great performance and features. It is definitely worth the price and it offers a lot of value for money. It is one of the best phones I have ever used and I don't regret buying it at all.\n",
